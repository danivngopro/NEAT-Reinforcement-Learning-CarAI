# NEAT-Reinforcement-Learning-CarAI

Using neat we create an AI that learn how to drive a car on a road.

#this project contains:

5 different maps
5 pretrained nn models
checkPoint.py - a class for saving and loading neural networks (nn)
newcar.py - the main project
config.txt - config file for NEAT
car.png - the car image.

the code is documented and explained, if you are a begginer i recommand you clone this repo and follow the documentation carefully.

run newcar.py for a the learning to start.
